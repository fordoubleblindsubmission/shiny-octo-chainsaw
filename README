TO RUN PMA TESTS

run make

at the end, you should have an "opt" binary

mv opt opt_1.1 

then run pma-meta.sh

output will be in pma_10M_small.out and cpma_10M_small.out

TO RUN ASPEN

in aspen/code
build the tests with build-tests.sh

then run them with aspen-tests.sh


TO RUN HT / PAM
install parlaylib: https://github.com/cmuparlay/parlaylib
and PAM (https://cmuparlay.github.io/PAMWeb/), which depends on parlaylib

put this function where the parlaylib hash table was installed:
sequence<eType> reduce() {                                                                         

    return reduce(delayed_map(TA, [&] (eType v) { return (v != empty) ? 0 : v;}));                           

  }  

then to run the tests, go to parlaytest/

to build ht/pam, use build-ht.sh and build-pam.sh

run ht tests with run-10M-ht-tests.py

run pam tests with run-pam-tests.py
